# Problem: top level managers want to audit the data of power BI report generated by the Finance Team. but they don't have the experience in excel or power Bi, they ask the intern to find a solution for this!
# Technical_Intern (ME) : I will make a application for you which you have to do only click and go! , my application will handle all the background work you.
 Application Description:
Here a simple dashboard was created by using PyQt5. This application can plot any kind of graphs from any kind of data sets,  this also cleans the Data in order for proper visula. The whole operation could be conducted in power_bi, the main difference where this application is superior than the power bi is that it provides the usability to generate any kindn of graphs from any kind of datasets regardless, it is about sensor or any specific form of data set. It can render them all and describe values in the chart form. It also gives the user the freedom to choose from x axis and y axis, in which way he/she likes. They also don;t need any experience of excel or power bi or even Excel!
